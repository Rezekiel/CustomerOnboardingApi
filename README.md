# Customer Onboarding Microservice API
This is a microservice API built with **ASP.NET Core** that handles customer onboarding with OTP verification, stateâ€“LGA validation, and external bank listing integration.

Requirements
Build a Microservice Api that would have the following endpoints:
1. Onboard a customer: The endpoint should take phone Number, email, password,
state of residence, and LGA.
Business Rule
(i) The phone number should be verified via OTP before onboarding is said to be
completed
(ii) The LGA must be mapped to the state selected.
(iii) Mock sending the OTP.

2. Endpoint to return all existing customers previously onboarded

3. An endpoint that will return the existing Bank: browse the link below, you will find an
endpoint called Getbanks. Consume that endpoint and output the result you

Note.
- Use ASP.NET Core to build the api, add Swagger documentation
- Use Microsoft SQL DB and Entity Framework.
- ensure that you apply all standard engineering principles, be mindful of the pattern you
apply and also consider adding unit testing
- Push your code to a public git repo and share the link
